# Timur Turatali

**Lead ML Engineer** | Building AI-Powered Systems in FinTech & Healthcare | Open-Source AI for Low-Resource Languages


## What I Do

I build end-to-end machine learning systems that drive real business outcomes—from LLM-powered conversational AI to credit risk models processing terabytes of data. Specializing in production ML infrastructure, on-device AI, and NLP for underrepresented languages.

**Recent Impact:**
- Co-founded CorePod: privacy-first on-device LLM for sleep AI (100+ beta users, NVIDIA Inception)
- Created AkylAI: first Kyrgyz-language LLM chatbot (20K+ users)

## Core Expertise

**ML/AI:** PyTorch, LLMs, RAG, On-Device AI, Production ML Systems  
**MLOps:** ClearML, K8S, Triton, Weights & Biases, Vertex AI  
**Data:** ClickHouse, FeatureStore, Hadoop, Spark, ElasticSearch  
**NLP:** Hugging Face, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Weaviate, Voice AI (TTS/STT)

## Featured Projects

### 🇰🇬 [The Cramer Project](https://huggingface.co/the-cramer-project)
Co-founder of Kyrgyzstan's national open-source AI initiative. Built the country's first LLM chatbot, created the first Kyrgyz language benchmark, and released the largest Kyrgyz text corpus (300M+ words). Organized 50+ AI meetups and 3 DataThons with 250+ participants.

### 🎯 [KyrgyzLLM-Bench](https://github.com/golden-ratio/kyrgyzLLM_bench)
First standardized benchmark for evaluating LLMs in the Kyrgyz language. Contributed Kyrgyz language support to [Hugging Face LightEval](https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval). Essential infrastructure for low-resource NLP research.

### 💤 CorePod (Stealth)
Architected privacy-first, fully on-device LLM and voice AI stack for real-time conversational sleep companion. Combined CBT-I sleep science with contextual ML, deployed to 100+ beta users with measurable improvements in sleep quality.

## Research & Community

- **GP2.org Contributor:** Applying AI to Parkinson's genetics research (ASAP-affiliated program)
- **National AI Council Member:** Advising on Kyrgyzstan's AI policy and strategy
- **[AI Community Founder](https://www.aicommunity.kg/):** Built 2K+ member community uniting ML engineers and data scientists

## Background

- 10+ years building ML systems in FinTech (Citibank, MBank, EY)
- Master's in Applied Mathematics & CS from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology
- Led technical teams at scale (10+ FTEs) and mentored engineers to promotion
